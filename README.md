Source files for the "SANYA" Bioreactor

To guarantee the success of our project we needed to maintain the exceptional conditions for our yeast strain. For this purpose, we created a cutting edge masterpiece of modern engineering, a piece of art basically, called "SANYA." This is our very own in-house designed bioreactor, build with out-of-the-way precision and attention to details. 
SANYA fulfills all the yeast demands for the environment. It keeps under control a suitable temperature and illumination conditions for the yeast. Also, it provides the cells with a mixing mechanism to keep all the cells evenly illuminated and supplemented.
All of that enables our yeast to feel comfortable and happy while working for the benefit of humanity!!!
